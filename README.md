# Example repo for Make Python Devex

This repository contains a simple Python® project setup
using the Make Python DevEx system described and built by Colin Dean.
Read more about why this exists at the Target Tech blog post
[Make Python DevEx](https://tech.target.com/blog/make-python-devex).

Run `make help` to see the tasks available.

In theory, run `make deps` until it succeeds, following any instructions output
in the meantime.
Then, run `make check test build` to build the distributable.
Run `poetry run example-make-python-devex` to see the app in action.

This system was built for and tested primarily on Apple® macOS® 11 and later.
It may work on Linux with adjustments; PRs welcome.
