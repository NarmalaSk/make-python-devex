# Example repo for Make Python Devex

This repository contains a simple Python project setup
using the Make Python DevEx system described and built by Colin Dean.

Run `make help` to see the tasks available.

In theory, run `make deps` until it succeeds, following any instructions output
in the meantime.
Then, run `make check test build` to build the distributable.
Run `poetry run example-make-python-devex` to see the app in action.
